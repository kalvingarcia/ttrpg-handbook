# Using this Guide
The goal of this Table Top Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) Handbook is to provide the information necessary for players to understand the game and to create their characters. The rules of the TTRPG are inspired by Dungeons & Dragons. There is some content that follows a similar structure with a few changes for balancing.

## General Flow
The gameplay has a specific flow.

1. Observation-- The game master (GM or DM) describes the environment.
2. Action-- The players describe what they want their characters to do. This is usually done in turns and the DM decides how the actions are resolved.
3. Reaction-- The GM narrates the result of the action, which sometimes might involve a new description of environment or failure or success. This, in turn, leads back to step 1.

## The Three Pillars
The game is only as limited as the imagination of the player. Characters can do anything (within the confines of the rules and at the behest of the GM).

* Exploration--- Moving through the world and interacting with various objects. Entering new dungeons and new environments. The players describe what they want to do, and the GM will describe the consequence of the action (remember the 3 step process: Description, Action, Reaction).
* Social Interaction--- The players will also need to talk to other, whether it be Non-Player Characters (NPCs) or other players' characters. This can be straight forward conversation, or involve a more round-about approach: deception, persuasion, performance.
* Combat--- The last pillar, the players will fight other creatures within the game. The players can plan, execute, and do anything their hearts and abilities will them to do. Magic is also an important part of the game and combat.
