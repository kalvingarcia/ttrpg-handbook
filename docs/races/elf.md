# Elf
Slender and graceful, elves have unearthly, fine features, being hauntingly beautiful creatures of fey-ancestry. Standing slightly shorter than humans, on average from 5 to 6 feet.

Elves can live for over 700 years, giving them broad perspective of events that trouble short-lived races. They find the day-to-day tedium to be amusing, remaining aloof in the face of petty drivel.

## Names
Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after their hundredth birthday. They have child-names until they make their declaration, where they select their own adult-name.

Often, those who watched the elf grow continue to call them by their child-name. The adult-name being a unique creation by each individual, marginally affected by their family or respected individuals in their life.
