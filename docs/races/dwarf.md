# Dwarf
Generally, dwarves are stout, hardy creatures. They stand under 5 feet, but their courage and endurance are matched by their burly build, weighing as much as humans two feet taller than them.

Dwarves live for more than 400 years, so the oldest tend to remember times from a different and bygone era. This tends to make them stubborn in leaving tradition behind, but loyal to those they care for.

## Names
A dwarf doesn't *own* their name. The name is given to them by a clan elder, in accordance to tradition. These names have been passed down for generations, and a dwarf who brings shame to the clan loses it, forbidden to use any dwarven name in its place.
