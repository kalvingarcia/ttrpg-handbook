# Gnome
Gnomes enthusiastically love living and it shows in every action in their life. Though like all races with divisions in culture, some gnomes live more pragmatic, utilitarian lives.

No matter what a gnome does, they do with all their will power. They live their approximately 500 year lives doing their best to enjoy living.
## Names
Most gnomes love names, and have many of them. Every family member may call them something different: a hereditary name or a brand new creation, some even a nickname that might never stick.

When dealing with other races with more conventional naming-systems, gnomes tend to choose their favorite given name and their family name.
