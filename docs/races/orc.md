# Orc
Once considered a savage and fearless race, orcs are a misunderstood, but passionate people. They live shorter lives than humans, but they are spent bringing glory to their tribes.

Orcs have toughness and tenacity that can only be matched by their stature. Their devotion, traditions, and customs are often abused by those seeking to do harm, but orcs were among the first defenders of the natural order from the encroachments of Fiends and other extraplanar threats.
