# Creating a Character
I'd like to start off by suggesting you have a character in mind before starting the build process. Race and Class generally don't have anything to do with personality and ability, but there are stereotypes which lead to a "general rule" or "the average" for certain aspects.

Like I said, I'd have a personality, goals, aspirations, and skills you'd like to employ in mind before trying to make the character, so it's less overwhelming.

## Choose a Race
Every character has a race. The list of available races will be available in #races. This section will explain what they are. Races are the culture, the nurture, the nature (to some degrees), and the heritage of a character. There is always room to change and spice up some of these aspects since they're usually there for flavor. One the vanilla ways to spice it up is a subrace, which are listed under the race and provide changes to the flavor of the race through new abilities, skills, or culture.

The race will also establish how your character generally looks, but I have laid out a structure which allows more inclusivity within this and other facets. For example, base Dungeons & Dragons (5e) usually requires races get certain ability score increases (or decreases) and proficiencies from their race, but Tasha's Cauldron of Everything adds rule alterations that allow the player to customize their origin to some degree. I have taken some inspiration from these sources to outline the races.

## Choose a Class
A class constitutes the abilities, skills, and proficiencies a character learns as they level up. This will change the strategies you can employ and how your character will interact with the world.

Because of the nature of some classes, certain personalities are expected from their members, but that isn't necessary, just another "average" to think of. Just like in reality there are "perceptions," sometimes there may be some in the game, which you may be able to use to your advantage or disadvantage: just like in reality.

### Hit Points and Hit Dice
Your character's hit points (HP) generally define how tough your character is in combat and other perilous situations. HP is determined by Hit Dice, which is short for Hit Point Dice.

At level 1, your character has one Hit Dice and the type of die is determined by your class. Your constitution modifier also helps determine your HP.

Your health is determined by this formula: 
$$
HP = \frac{(L + 1) * HD + 2 * (CM + 1) * L - 2}{2}
$$
Where $L$ is current level, $HD$ is hit dice type, and $CM$ is consitution modifier.

### Proficiency Bonus
Your class will feature a table which will show you the bonus you get for proficiency, determined by level. That proficiency bonus is added many aspects of your character:

* Attack rolls using weapons you're proficient with
* Attack rolls with spells you cast
* Ability checks using skills you're proficient in
* Ability checks using tools you're proficient with
* Saving throws you're proficient in
* Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting c1ass)

Your class (along with some races and backgrounds) determine your weapon, saving throw, and some skill proficiencies. If a circumstance suggests you add or multiply your proficiency bonus multiple times to a roll, you'd only do so once.

## Ability Scores
The game is often decided by dice rolls, which are modified by ability score modifiers. This means your character's ability scores determine the likelihood of an outcome. The ability scores your character should value most is usually determined by their personality, class, and race. A good rule of thumb is to make your saving throws the highest value you can.

## Describe Your Character
Here is where you'll flesh out the character as a person. What are their goals, their aspirations, their personality. You determine their personality using alignment which is the character's moral compass.

Your character's personality was shaped by their origin, which gives them special features:

* ***Ability score increase.*** Three ability scores of your choice increase by 1.
* ***Feat.*** Choose a feat marked <span class="md-tag">Origin</span> that makes sense with your backstory.
* ***Skills.*** Choose two skills to gain proficiency in.
* ***Tools.*** Choose a set of tools to gain proficiency in, and gain those tools.

Your origin story should include bonds and flaws. Bonds, which are people, places, ideals that your character hold dear. They are things which when lost fundamentally alters your character's perception of the world. Flaws, which are aspects of themselves that they must work through or which constantly hold them back. Remember, you're making a person, so they can't be perfect; they will grow and change over the course of their adventure.

## Choose Equipment
Your class will determine your starting equipment. Your armor, weapon, and other adventuring gear will make up the bulk of this equipment.

### Armor and Armor Class
Armor will determine the AC of your character, which means how difficult it is to hit them. Without armor, the character gets an AC equal to 10 + their dexterity modifier

To use and wear certain shield armor, your character will need to be proficient in that particular item type. These are determined by class. Some class features give you a different way to calculate AC. If you have many ways to calculate your AC, then choose whichever you want to use.

### Weapons
Each weapon will have a modifier when attacking and when dealing damage.

* For attacks with melee weapons, use your strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your dexterity modifier instead.
* For attacks with ranged weapons, use your dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the thrown property, such as a hand-axe, can use your strength modifier instead.

## Gaining a Level
Whenever your character gains a level, their class often grants them additional features. These are included in the class's description. Some allow increasing ability scores, but an ability score can't be increased more than 20. In addition, proficiency bonuses go up as you progress in level:

* Levels 1-4 the bonus is +2
* Levels 5-8 the bonus is +3
* Levels 9-12 the bonus is +4
* Levels 13-16 the bonus is +5
* Levels 17-20 (MAX) the bonus is +6

Whenever you level up or your constitution ability score changes, it's important to recalculate your HP.
