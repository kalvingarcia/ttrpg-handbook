# Drow High Magic[^1] <span class="md-tag">General</span> <span class="md-tag">Racial</span>
***Innate Magical Attunement.*** You learn more of the magic typical of dark elves. You learn the Detect Magic spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn Levitate and Dispel Magic, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast those two spells in this way when you finish a long rest.

[^1]: ***Prerequisite:*** Elf (Drow)
