***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your dexterity score by 1.<br>
***Ignore Loading.*** You ignore the Loading property of the Hand Crossbow, Heavy Crossbow, and Light Crossbow (all called crossbows elsewhere in this feat). If you're holding one of them, you can load a piece of ammunition into it even if you lack a free hand.<br>
***Firing in Melee.*** Being within 5 feet of an enemy doesn't impose *disadvantage* on your attack rolls with crossbows.<br>
***Dual Wielding.*** When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the extra attack if that attack is with a crossbow that has the Light property and you aren't already adding that modifier to the damage.

[^1]: ***Prerequisite:*** Level 4+, Dexterity 13+
