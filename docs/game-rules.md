# Game Rules
## General Rules
The gameplay has a specific flow.

1. Observation-- The game master (GM or DM) describes the environment.
2. Action-- The players describe what they want their characters to do. This is usually done in turns and the DM decides how the actions are resolved.
3. Reaction-- The GM narrates the result of the action, which sometimes might involve a new description of environment or failure or success. This, in turn, leads back to step 1.

## Game Dice
The game is played with polyhedral dice. The conventional way to refer to a die is by the notation, not the actual geometric shape. The letter $d$ followed by the number of faces: $d2$, $d4$, $d6$, $d8$, $d10$, $d12$, $d20$, and $d100$.

The usual notation used for rolling is $NdF+M$, where $N$ is the number of dice, $F$ is the number of faces, and $M$ is the roll's modifier. For a roll that looks like $3d6+5$, this would mean roll 3 six-sided dice and add 5 to the resulting roll.
### Percentile Dice
The $d100$ is referred to as a percentile dice. These work a little differently, where rather than roll for the number, the number is generated. Two different $d10$ are rolled. One gives the tens place and the other gives the ones.
### The d20
The "default" die for the game is the $d20$. It decides the success and failure of many actions. The resulting roll is generally modified by a character's ability score modifiers.

The success and failure is generally decided by a difficulty class (DC) or armor class (AC). Sometimes the DC or AC are explicit, but often times the GM decides. The goal is to meet or exceed the DC or AC.
### Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes an roll gets a special modification called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage mean rolling two dice (or rolling twice) and taking the higher roll. Disadvantage is the opposite situation, roll two and take the lower roll.
## Other Rules
Specific rules overrule general rules, and when dividing a number in game, round the result down if not whole.
## Adventures and Campaigns
The game consists of a group of characters (sometimes a single player) going on an adventure. The characters all bring a set of skills to the group, forming a party of specialists. The adventure, often called a campaign, forms the heart of the story.

Throughout the adventure, the characters will encounter many friends, foe, and obstacles. This journey leads to character's growing and changing over the course of the campaign, whether through levels or through.
### The Three Pillars
The game is only as limited as the imagination of the player. Characters can do anything (within the confines of the rules and at the behest of the GM).

* Exploration--- Moving through the world and interacting with various objects. Entering new dungeons and new environments. The players describe what they want to do, and the GM will describe the consequence of the action (remember the 3 step process: Description, Action, Reaction).
* Social Interaction--- The players will also need to talk to other, whether it be Non-Player Characters (NPCs) or other players' characters. This can be straight forward conversation, or involve a more round-about approach: deception, persuasion, performance.
* Combat--- The last pillar, the players will fight other creatures within the game. The players can plan, execute, and do anything their hearts and abilities will them to do. Magic is also an important part of the game and combat.
